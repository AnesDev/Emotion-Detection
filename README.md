Emotion-Detection

Emotion-Detection is an interactive demo that automatically identifies faces and detects emotions from a live camera feed or static images. It’s designed for quick showcases—perfect for events where you want to demonstrate how computers can interpret facial expressions in real time.

When someone steps in front of the camera, the system locates their face and overlays an emoji and emotion label (like 😀 Happy or 😢 Sad). Everything updates instantly, giving guests a smooth, engaging experience.

The project runs on Python and uses:

OpenCV for face detection

TensorFlow for emotion prediction

Pillow for rendering emoji overlays

No coding knowledge needed. Start it up, and let people test it on the spot.
